## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Bootstrap 5** with custom CSS for responsive design
- **Lucide React** for modern icons
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Axios** for HTTP requests to the backend API

### Backend
- **.NET Core 8** Web API with Entity Framework Core
- **PostgreSQL** database with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user management
- **File Upload System** for handling book images and files
- **BCrypt** for secure password hashing

### Database Schema

#### Books Table
- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
- `name`: Book title
- `category`: Book category/genre
- `price`: Book price in USD
- `description`: Book description
- `user_id`: Author/owner ID (foreign key)
- `image_url`: Cover image URL
- `file_url`: Book file URL
- `file_name`: Original filename
- `file_size`: File size in bytes
- `created_at`: Publication timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last modification timestamp

#### Users Table
- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
- `email`: User email address (unique)
- `password_hash`: Hashed password using BCrypt
- `full_name`: User's full name
- `created_at`: Account creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last update timestamp

### Security Features

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: BCrypt with salt for secure password storage
- **Protected Endpoints**: API endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **User Ownership**: Users can only modify their own books

#### File Storage Security
- **Separate Directories**: Images and files stored in different directories
- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed file types can be uploaded
- **Size Limits**: Maximum file sizes enforced (5MB for images, 100MB for books)
- **Unique Filenames**: Prevents conflicts and unauthorized access

## File Upload System

### Supported File Types
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF for book covers
- **Books**: PDF, EPUB, DOCX, DOC, TXT, MOBI, AZW3

### Storage Structure
```
wwwroot/uploads/images/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {bookId}-{timestamp}.jpg
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {bookId}-{timestamp}.png

wwwroot/uploads/books/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {bookId}-{timestamp}.pdf
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {bookId}-{timestamp}.epub
```

### Upload Process
1. Files are uploaded to the .NET Core API via multipart form data
2. Unique filenames prevent conflicts
3. Files are stored in the wwwroot directory for static serving
4. File metadata is stored in the database

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- PostgreSQL database

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bookstore-app
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend/BookStore.API
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Database Configuration**
   Update the connection string in `backend/BookStore.API/appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=bookstore;Username=your_username;Password=your_password"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **JWT Configuration**
   Update the JWT settings in `backend/BookStore.API/appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "JwtSettings": {
       "SecretKey": "your-super-secret-jwt-key-that-should-be-at-least-32-characters-long",
       "Issuer": "BookStore.API",
       "Audience": "BookStore.Client",
       "ExpirationInDays": 7
     }
   }
   ```

## Development

### Backend Development
The .NET Core API follows clean architecture principles:
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Business logic and JWT token management
- **Repositories**: Data access layer with Entity Framework
- **Models**: Entity definitions and database schema
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects for API communication

### Frontend Development
The React frontend uses modern patterns:
- **Components**: Reusable UI components with TypeScript
- **Services**: API communication layer with Axios
- **Contexts**: State management with React Context
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for common functionality

### Adding New Features
1. **Backend**: Add new controllers, services, or repositories as needed
2. **Database**: Create migrations for schema changes
3. **Frontend**: Update services and components to use new API endpoints
4. **Types**: Update TypeScript interfaces to match API changes
